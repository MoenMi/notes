## 11.1 Inferences About a Population Variance

The point estimator of the population variance $\sigma^2$ is the sample variance $s^2$:

$$ s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1} $$

When making inferences about the population variance, the sampling distribution of 
$$\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma^2}$$
is helpful. This distribution can be modeled by a **chi-square** distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.
