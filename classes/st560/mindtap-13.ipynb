For each population, the response variable is normally distributed.\n","2. The variance of the response variable, denoted &sigma;<sup>2</sup>, is the same for all of the populations.\n","3. The observations must be independent.\n","\n","### Analysis of Variance: A Conceptual Overview\n","\n","If the means for the three populations are equal, we would expect the three sample means to be close together. In fact, the closer the three sample means are to one another, the weaker the evidence we have for the conclusion that the population means differ. In other words, if the variability among the sample means is small, it supports <em>H<sub>0</sub></em>, and if the variability is large, it supports <em>H<sub>a</sub></em>.\n","\n","#### Example\n","\n","$$ \\bar{x}_{1} = 62 $$\n","$$ \\bar{x}_{2} = 66 $$\n","$$ \\bar{x}_{3} = 52 $$\n","\n","We estimate the overall mean of the sample to be the average of the sample means:\n","\n","$$ \\mu_{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{62+66+52}{3} = 60 $$\n","\n","The variance of the sampling distribution of $ \\bar{x} $ is:\n","\n","$$ s_{\\bar{x}}^{2} = \\frac{(62-60)^{2}+(66-60)^{2}+(52-60)^{2}}{3-1} = \\frac{104}{2} = 52 $$\n","\n","Because $ \\sigma_{\\bar{x}}^{2} = \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n} $, we can see that:\n","\n","$$ \\sigma^{2} = n\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}^{2} $$\n","\n","Therefore,\n","\n","$$ Estimate~of~\\sigma^{2} = n(Estimate~of~\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}^{2}) = ns_{\\bar{x}}^{2} = 5(52) = 260 $$\n","\n","This result of $ ns_{\\bar{x}}^{2} = 260 $ is called the **between-treatments estimate** of $ ns_{\\bar{x}}^{2} $."]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
