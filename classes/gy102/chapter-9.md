# 9 - Understanding Landscapes

## 9.1 - What Materials Compose Landscapes?

A **mineral** is a naturally occurring, inorganic solid with an ordered (crystalline) internal structure and a relatively consistent chemical composition.

The most common family of minerals is **silicate minerals**, which account for over 90% of the mineral's in Earth's crust. Most of these minerals contain (SiO$_4$)$^{-4}$. Common silicate minerals include:
- **Quartz** (SiO$_2$) is a relatively hard mineral that is generally transparent to white.
- **Feldspar** is a very common mineral that comes in two varieties: *potassium feldspar* and *plagioclase feldspar*.
- **Mica** is a family of minerals that break into sheets and flakes.
- **Mafic minerals** contain magnesium and iron in addition to silicon and oxygen.

Minerals that do not contain silicon are called **nonsilicate minerals**, and and this group includes salt. Common nonsilicate minerals include:
- **Carbonate minerals** contain carbon and oxygen bonded with other elements.
- **Oxide minerals** contain oxygen bonded with a metallic element.
- **Salt minerals** include several families, including **halite** (NaCl) and **gypsum**.
- **Sulfide minerals** contain sulfur bonded with a metallic element.

## 9.2 - How Do Rocks Form?

Loose material formed by the breaking and wearing away of other rocks in the landscape is called **sediment**. These may be formed around glaciers, steep mountain fronts, sand dunes, beaches, stream channels, and more.

Changing a rock by heat, pressure, or deformation is the process of **metamorphism**.

## 9.3 - What Can Happen to a Rock?

- A rock on the surface interacts with sunlight, rain, wind, plants, and animals. As a result, it may be mechanically broken apart or altered by chemical reactions via the process of **weathering**.
- Rock pieces loosened or dissolved by weathering can be stripped away by **erosion** and moved away from their source.
- When the kinetic energy associated with transportation stops, water, wind, and ice **deposit** their sediment.
- In the process of **lithification**, sediment becomes sedimentary rock by being compacted.
- After a rock forms, strong forces can squeeze the rock and fold its layers in a process called **deformation**.
- A rock exposed to high temperatures may **melt** and form magma.
- The process of magma cooling to become rock is called **solidification**. If crystals form during solidification, it is called **crystallization**.
- A rock may be **uplifted** to the surface where it is exposed to weathering.

## 9.4 - What Are Some Common Sedimentary Rocks?

**Clastic rocks** are sedimentary rocks that are composed of rock and mineral pieces, called **clasts**. We describe and classify clastic sedimentary rocks based primarily on the size of clasts, along with other aspects such as clast roundness.
- Gravel-sized clasts:
  - **Conglomerate** has large, rounded clasts (pebbles, cobbles, or boulders) with sand and other fine sediment between the large clasts.
  - **Breccia** is similar to conglomerate except that the clasts are angular and the clasts range in size.
- Sand-sized clasts:
  - **Sandstone** consists of sand-sized grains. It can contain some larger and smaller clasts, but it is mostly composed of sand.
- Mud-sized clasts:
  - **Shale** consists mostly of fine-grained clasts. The minerals are aligned, so the rock breaks in sheetlike pieces or chips.

**Nonclastic rocks** are sedimentary rocks not composed of clasts.
- **Rock salt** refers to rocks mostly composed of the mineral halite (NaCl).
- **Gypsum** refers to both a mineral and rocks composed mostly of the mineral.
- **Limestone** is mostly made of calcium carbonate, which forms when shells and coral skeletons are cemented together. Many limestones contain fossils.
- **Chalk** is a soft, very fine-grained limestone that forms from the accumulation of dead microscopic organisms.
- **Chert** is a silica-rich rock that can form in a variety of ways.
- **Iron formation** is a rock composed of thick layers of iron oxide. Most iron formations precipitated from seawater early in Earth's history, and it is the main source of iron used in steel.
- **Coal** is formed from wood and other plant parts that have been buried, compacted, and heated enough to drive off most of their water and oxygen.

## 9.6 - What Are Metamorphic Processes and Rocks?

For a rock to be metamorphosed, it must be subjected to conditions of temperature, pressure, and fluid chemistry that make it unstable.
- **Contact metamorphism** is caused by local heating by magma, typically without deformation.
- **Regional metamorphism** involves deformation along with heating over a broader region.

During metamorphism, movement of chemical elements can cause existing minerals to grow larger or form new minerals. If minerals are arranged in lines, the rock has **lineation**. If they are arranged in planes, the rock has **foliation**.

- When shale is metamorphosed at a low to moderate temperature, it can develop **cleavage** and become **slate**.
  - At slightly higer temperatures, it becomes **phyllite**.
  - At higher temperatures, it becomes **schist**.
  - At even higher temperatures, it becomes **gneiss**.
- When sandstone is metamorphosed, it becomes **quartzite**.
  - At higher temperatures, it can become a coarser-grained quartzite.
- Limestone becomes **marble** at low temperatures.
  - At moderate temperatures, impurities in limestone may produce impurities.

## 9.7 - How Are Different Rock Types Expressed in Landscapes?

The unifying feature of most sedimentary rocks is the presence of visible layers.
- Some sandstone layers are resistant to erosion and appear massive from a distance because they have little variation of grain size. Sandstone layers may differ in color, grain size, and composition of grains.
- Shale and other fine-grained clastic sedimentary rocks are somewhat easily eroded. Where exposed, these rocks typically form soft slopes covered by small, loose chips. The resulting formations are known as **badlands**.
- Limestone is very soluble, so in wet climates it dissolves and weathers quickly, forming caves, sinkholes, pits, and depressions. The resulting terrain is known as **karst** terrain.

Igneous rocks form from magma, either from magma that solidifies below the surface, forming **intrusive (plutonic) rocks**, or magma that erupts onto the surface, forming **extrusive (volcanic) rocks**.
- Most granite is fractured, and becomes rounded when weathered in a process called **spheroidal weathering**.
- Volcanic rocks commonly have some sort of layers. Basaltic lava flows are the most common type of volcanic rock in most landscapes.
- Many volcanic units have distinctive columnar fractures called **columnar joints**.

Rocks that have been metamorphosed by increased temperature and pressure are metamorphic rocks.
- Metamorphic rocks commonly have mineral-filled fractures, called veins.
- Metamorphic rock generally forms platy, jagged outcrops in the terrain.

## 9.8 - What Controls the Appearance of Landscapes?

**Geomorphologists** are physical geographers and geologists who study the spatial pattern, form, and evolution of landforms.

## 9.11 - How Does Wind Help Shape Landscapes?

- Moderately strong winds can roll or slide grains of sand and other loose materials across the ground.
- Strong winds can lift grains, carry them short distances, and drop them. This process, called **saltation**, is akin to bouncing a grain along the surface.
- Wind can pick up and carry finer material, such as dust, silt, and salt, in a process called **suspension**.

## 9.12 - What Features Record Transport and Deposition of Material by the Wind?

There are different types of sand dunes, each of which forms with a shape specific to the wind directions:
- A **crescent dune** or **barchan dune** is a common dune type with a crescent shape. The tails point in the direction of the prevailing wind.
- **Transverse dunes** are linear or gently curved, and can be many kilometers long and hundreds of meters high. They are perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction.
- **Longitudinal dunes** are a type of linear dune that form parallel to the overall wind direction.
- **Composite dunes** are a combination of several different types.
- **Star dunes** have variably trending sand ridges radiating out from a central peak. They form where wind directions are highly variable.
- **Parabolic dunes** have a curved or parabolic shape, but they form with tails facing into the wind. They form when wind removes an area of vegetation.
