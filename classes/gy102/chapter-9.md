# 9 - Understanding Landscapes

## 9.1 - What Materials Compose Landscapes?

A **mineral** is a naturally occurring, inorganic solid with an ordered (crystalline) internal structure and a relatively consistent chemical composition.

The most common family of minerals is **silicate minerals**, which account for over 90% of the mineral's in Earth's crust. Most of these minerals contain (SiO$_4$)$^{-4}$. Common silicate minerals include:
- **Quartz** (SiO$_2$) is a relatively hard mineral that is generally transparent to white.
- **Feldspar** is a very common mineral that comes in two varieties: *potassium feldspar* and *plagioclase feldspar*.
- **Mica** is a family of minerals that break into sheets and flakes.
- **Mafic minerals** contain magnesium and iron in addition to silicon and oxygen.

Minerals that do not contain silicon are called **nonsilicate minerals**, and and this group includes salt. Common nonsilicate minerals include:
- **Carbonate minerals** contain carbon and oxygen bonded with other elements.
- **Oxide minerals** contain oxygen bonded with a metallic element.
- **Salt minerals** include several families, including **halite** (NaCl) and **gypsum**.
- **Sulfide minerals** contain sulfur bonded with a metallic element.

## 9.2 - How Do Rocks Form?

Loose material formed by the breaking and wearing away of other rocks in the landscape is called **sediment**. These may be formed around glaciers, steep mountain fronts, sand dunes, beaches, stream channels, and more.

Changing a rock by heat, pressure, or deformation is the process of **metamorphism**.

## 9.3 - What Can Happen to a Rock?

- A rock on the surface interacts with sunlight, rain, wind, plants, and animals. As a result, it may be mechanically broken apart or altered by chemical reactions via the process of **weathering**.
- Rock pieces loosened or dissolved by weathering can be stripped away by **erosion** and moved away from their source.
- When the kinetic energy associated with transportation stops, water, wind, and ice **deposit** their sediment.
- In the process of **lithification**, sediment becomes sedimentary rock by being compacted.
- After a rock forms, strong forces can squeeze the rock and fold its layers in a process called **deformation**.
- A rock exposed to high temperatures may **melt** and form magma.
- The process of magma cooling to become rock is called **solidification**. If crystals form during solidification, it is called **crystallization**.
- A rock may be **uplifted** to the surface where it is exposed to weathering.

## 9.4 - What Are Some Common Sedimentary Rocks?

**Clastic rocks** are sedimentary rocks that are composed of rock and mineral pieces, called **clasts**. We describe and classify clastic sedimentary rocks based primarily on the size of clasts, along with other aspects such as clast roundness.

Gravel-sized clasts:
- **Conglomerate** has large, rounded clasts (pebbles, cobbles, or boulders) with sand and other fine sediment between the large clasts.
- **Breccia** is similar to conglomerate except that the clasts are angular and the clasts range in size.

Sand-sized clasts:
- **Sandstone** consists of sand-sized grains. It can contain some larger and smaller clasts, but it is mostly composed of sand.

Mud-sized clasts:
- **Shale** consists mostly of fine-grained clasts. The minerals are aligned, so the rock breaks in sheetlike pieces or chips.
