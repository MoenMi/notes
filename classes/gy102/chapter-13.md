# 13 - Streams and Flooding

## 13.1 - What Are Stream Systems?

The amount of water flowing in a stream at any given time is called its **discharge**, which is measured in cubic meters per second ($m^3/s$).

$$ Q = \text{stream depth} \times \text{stream width} \times \text{average stream velocity} $$

A **hydrograph** shows the change in discharge over time.

A **drainage basin** is an area in which all drainages merge into a single stream or move to a single body of water.
- A ridge between two basins is the boundary between water flowing into different drainage basins and is a **drainage divide**.

The **stream order** system is a tree-based hierarchy for steams, where first-order stream has no tributaries, a second-order stream is formed by the convergence of two first-order streams, and so on.

There are a number of drainage patterns that channels may form, including
- A **dendritic drainage pattern** is where the channels form a tree-like drainage pattern.
- A **radial drainage pattern** is where drainages flow downhill and outward from a fairly symmetrical mountain.
  - A **centripetal drainage pattern** is when drainages flow inward from several directions.
- A **structurally controlled pattern** is where erosion along fractures, tilts, or folds can produce a drainage that follows a layer or structure, and then cuts across a ridge at a near 90 degree angle to follow a different feature, forming a **trellis drainage pattern**.

## 13.2 - How Do Streams Transport Sediment and Erode Their Channels?

The amount of sediment carried by a stream is called its **stream load**.
- Fine materials can be suspended in moving water, where these materials are called the **suspended load**.
- Sand gains can roll along the bottom or be picked up and carried down-current by bouncing along the streambed in the process of **saltation**.
- Larger cobbles and boulders generally move by rolling and sliding in times of high flow in a process called **traction**. The size of the largest particles that can be transported are called the stream's **competence**.
- Material that is bounced, rolled, and slid along the streambed is the **bed load**.
- Some chemically soluble ions, such as calcium, sodium, and chlorine, are dissolved in the water and transported along with it as the **dissolved load**.

The following processes erode material in streams:
- In the process of **abrasion**, grains move downstream and collide with obstacles, where they chip, scrape, and sandblast pieces off the streambed. Abrasion is concentrated on the upstream side of obstructions.
- Concentrated erosion can occur when water and sediment swirl in small depressions, carving bowl-shaped pits called **potholes**.
- Soluble material in the streambed can be removed by **dissolution**.

Water moving smoothly in parallel layers is called **laminar flow**. Fast flow through rough, obstruction-filled streams is called **turbulent flow**.

Streams that are carved into the bedrock are called **bedrock streams** and are common in mountainous areas. These streams cut out steep canyons in the process called **downcutting**.

## 13.3 - How Do Streams Change Downstream or Over Short Time Frames?

A stream flows downhill from its **headwaters** to its **mouth**. The direction of flow from high elevations to lower ones is called **downstream**.

A **perennial stream** is one that flows all year. **Intermittent streams** flow every year but are seasonal. **Ephemeral streams** flow only after storm events.

## 13.4 - What Factors Influence Profiles of Streams?

The lowest level to which a stream can erode is its **base level**.

The following factors influence a stream's profile:
- Rock type
- Tectonics
- Sea level
- Climate
- Stability of conditions

If conditions in a stream remain stable it may approach an **equilibrium profile**. We call such a stream a **graded stream**.

## 13.5 - Why Do Streams Have Curves?

The amount that a channel curves for a given length is its **sinuosity** and can be calculated by dividing channel length by the down-valley length.

**Braided streams** are characterized by a network of interweaving, sinuous channels, but the overall channel can be fairly straight.

A single channel stream that is gently curved is referred to as a **low sinuosity stream**.

**Meandering streams** have channels that are very curved. These streams have high sinuosity, and the types of bends are called **meanders**.

A channel is shallower and the water velocity is lower on the inside of a bend, causing sediment to be deposited on the inside of the bend in a crescent-shaped deposit of loose sediment called a **point bar**.

## 13.8 - What Features Characterize Low-Gradient Streams?

Meandering rivers leave behind depressions called **meander scars**, that become **oxbow lakes** when filled with water.

Many streams have older floodplains perched above and outside the current floodplain called **terraces**. The steep slope separating adjacent terraces or a terrace from a floodplain is called a **bluff** or a **riser**.

Some low-gradient streams have islands between several strands of the channel that split and rejoin. These channels are called **anastomosing channels**, which are distinct from meandering, braided, and straight channels.
