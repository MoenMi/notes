# 13 - Streams and Flooding

## 13.1 - What Are Stream Systems?

The amount of water flowing in a stream at any given time is called its **discharge**, which is measured in cubic meters per second ($m^3/s$).

$$ Q = \text{stream depth} \times \text{stream width} \times \text{average stream velocity} $$

A **hydrograph** shows the change in discharge over time.

A **drainage basin** is an area in which all drainages merge into a single stream or move to a single body of water.
- A ridge between two basins is the boundary between water flowing into different drainage basins and is a **drainage divide**.

The **stream order** system is a tree-based hierarchy for steams, where first-order stream has no tributaries
