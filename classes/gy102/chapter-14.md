# 14 - Glaciers

## 14.1 - What Are Glaciers?

In some parts of ice sheets, the bedrock is high enough to protrude through the ice sheet, forming a feature called a **nunatak**.

Glaciers that form in mountainous regions without being part of a regional ice sheet are called **alpine glaciers**.

As some valley glaciers or ice sheets flow out of the mountains into broader, less confined topography, the glaciers can spread out, forming **piedmont glaciers**.

## 14.2 - What Is the Distribution of Present and Past Glaciers?

The time within an ice age when ice sheets and glaciers advanced are called **glacial periods**, while the time when they retreated is called **interglacial periods**.x
