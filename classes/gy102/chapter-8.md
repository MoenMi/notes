# 8 - Water Resources

## 8.1 - Where Does Water Occur on the Planet?

The circulation of water from one reservoir to another is called the **hydrologic cycle**.
- **Sublimation** is when water molecules go directly from ice to vapor.
- **Groundwater flow** describes water that falls below the roots of plants and becomes groundwater.
- **Transpiration** describes precipitation and soil water that is taken in by plants.

## 8.2 - What is the Global Water Budget?

**Flux** is a measurement of how much water moves in and out of a store, described in units of volume over time.

The length of time that a drop of water remains in a store is called its **residence time**.

## 8.3 - How Do We Evaluate Water Balances?

The **climatic water balance** is an accounting of the amount of water in each store and its flux through the hydrologic cycle.
