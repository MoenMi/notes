# 12 - Weathering and Mass Wasting

**Mass wasting** is the movement of material downslope in response to gravity. It is caused by physical weathering.

## 12.1 - How Does Physical Weathering Affect Earth's Surface?

**Joints** are fractures in rocks that help break them into smaller pieces and permit water and roots to penetrate the rock, promoting more weathering.

## 12.2 - How Does Chemical Weathering Affect Earth's Surface?

Chemical weathering can make rocks dissolve or break down existing minerals, producing new minerals called **secondary minerals**.

Chemical weathering can occur in the following ways:
- **Dissolution**: Some minerals are soluble in water and can dissolve in water and be carried away in streams or groundwater.
- **Oxidation**: Some minerals bond with oxygen to form oxide minerals.
- **Hydrolysis**: Silicate minerals react chemically with water, converting the original minerals into clay minerals.
- **Biological Reactions**: Decaying plants produce acids and some bacteria consume parts of rocks.
