# 17 - Ecosystems

The provisions and constraints of the physical environment along with the entire community of interacting organisms (plants, animals, and others) in an area is an **ecosystem**.

## 17.1 - How Is the Ecosystem Approach Useful in Understanding the Biosphere?

**Ecology** is the study of how organisms and populations of organisms interact with one another and with the nonliving components of their environment.

**Biogeopgraphy** uses ecological principles to explain the distribution of life.

## 17.3 - What Types of Interactions Occur in Ecosystems?

Organisms that acquire what they need from the soil, water, air, and energy of the environment, without consuming other organisms, are called **autotrophs** or **primary producers**.

Organisms that acquire their food from other organisms are called **heterotrophs**.

**Competition** occurs when many organisms compete for limited resources. It results in winners and losers.

In **symbiosis**, species have life-long interactions. There are several different types:
- **Mutualism:** Both species benefit from the interaction.
- **Commensalism:** One species benefits and the other is largely unaffected.
- **Parasitism:** One species may benefit while the other is harmed.
- **Mimicry:** One species mimics the other.

As a chemical element or compound works its way up the food chain, it becomes more concentrated in a process called **biomagnification**.

## 17.4 - How Do Populations Change in Ecosystems?

**K-selected species** have slow rates of reproduction and maturation, but have strong and prolonged nurturing, with a higher likelihood of survival into adulthood.

**r-selected species** produce relatively frequent batches of numerous offspring. Offspring mature faster, but are less supervised, and many do not survive.

## 17.5 - What Is Biodiversity and How Is It Assessed?

The number of species present in an ecosystem is called its **richness**.

The **relative abundance** of a species refers to the population of the individual species.

The **Shannon Index (SI)** incorporates richness and relative abundance to describe the biodiversity of an ecosystem.

## 17.8 - How Do We Describe Ecosystem Productivity?

The **net primary productivity (NPP)** is the total amount of energy fixed for photosynthesis, which is the **gross primary productivity**, minus the energy wasted or used for plant respiration and maintaining existing tissue.

Differerences in NPP can be estimated using a factor called the **Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI)**.

## 17.9 - How Do Ecosystems React to Disturbance?

**Ecosystem stability** refers to the degree of fluctuation in population of a species over time.

An organism that can tolerate a wide range of conditions for a given abiotic factor is described with the **eury-** prefix, such as euryhaline for a creature that can tolerate a wide range of salinities. In contrast, **steno-** is used for organisms that cannot tolerate a wide range of conditions a given abiotic factor.

**Intertia** is the ability of an ecosystem to resist change after a stress is applied.

**Resilience** is the rate at which an ecosystem recovers following stress.

**Uniformitarianism** is the idea that the natural world in the past evolved by processes and rates similar to what we observe today. **Catastrophism** emphasizes the importance of sudden events in creating change.

**Succession** is how an ecosystem responds to stresses with a change in species composition. If succession begins with new land or so much disturbance that little life is able to survive, the recovery process is a **primary succession** that begins with a **pioneer community**. **Secondary succession** occurs when soil is present at the outset.

The **climax community** is the stable community that comes about after succession.

## 17.13 - How Does a Lack of Oxygen Harm Ecosystems?

The **biological oxygen demanded (BOD)** is the amount of oxygen required by organisms for respiration.

Consider a body of water that absorbs more dissolved gas when cold:
- The **limnetic/photic zone** is at the top of the body of water, and it is where more oxygen is generated from photosynthesis than is used by respiration or fermentation.
- The **profundal/aphotic zone** is at the bottom of the body of water, so more oxygen is used for respiration or fermentation than is produced by photosynthesis.
- The **compensation point** is the level where oxygen production and consumption are balanced.

**Hypoxia** is a condition where oxygen is lacking in aquatic ecosystems.
