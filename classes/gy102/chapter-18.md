# 18 - Biomes

A number of adjacent ecosystems that together have a distinctive collection of flora and fauna, all adapted to regional enviornmental conditions, is a **biome**.

## 18.4 - How Does Topography Influence Biomes?

**Riparian zones** consist of trees, shrubs, and grasses that form along streams, creating a local environment that is more lush with vegetation than the surrounding land.

**Transhumance** is a type of seasonal nomadism in which people move to the optimal elevation to experience the best temperatures and animal fodder at a particular time of year.

## 18.8 - How Do Desert Organisms Survive?

Species that have built-in mechanisms that make them tolerant to arid environments are called **xerophytic**.

## 18.9 - What Are the Features of the Grassland Biome?

**Savannas** are grasslands in the tropics.

**Prairies** are grasslands outside the tropics that have tall grass.

**Steppes** are grasslands outside the tropics that have short grass.

## 18.10 - What Characterizes the Subtropical Scrub and Woodland Biome?

Scrub consists of small trees, bushes, and grasses. Woodlands are areas where trees are not dense enough to close the canopy.

Vegetation in this biome has developed a tolerance to drought and fire, an attribute termed **schlerophyllic**.
