Course Description
****************

An introduction to using computer algorithms to solve mathematical problems, such as data analysis, visualization, numerical approximation and simulation. Basic programming concepts, such as variables, statements, loops, branches, functions, data structures, and debugging will be introduced in Python. A brief introduction to MATLAB tools for handling vectors, matrices, and vectorizing codes for performance, will be discussed as well in the later portion of the course. Some advanced mathematical and computational topics may be offered at the discretion of instructor.
