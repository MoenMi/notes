# 1 - Information and Network Security Concepts

## 1.1 - Cybersecurity, Information Security, and Network Security

**Cybersecurity** is the protection of information that is stored, transmitted, and processed in a networked system of computers, other digital devices, and network devices and transmission lines, including the Internet. Protection encompasses confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, and accountability. Methods of protection include organizational policies and procedures, as well as technical means such as encryption and secure communications protocols.

The following are subsets of cybersecurity:

- **Information security** refers to preservation of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. In addition, other properties, such as authenticity, accountability, nonrepudiation, and reliability can also be involved.

- **Network Security** refers to protection of networks and their service from unauthorized modification, destruction, or disclosure, and provision of assurance that the network performs its critical functions correctly and there are no harmful side effects.

### Security Objectives

The **CIA Triad** lies at the heart of information and network security:

1. **Confidentiality** spans two related concepts:
    - **Data confidentiality** assures that private or confidential information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals.
    - **Privacy** assures that individuals control or influence what information related to them may be collected and stored and by whom that information may be disclosed.
2. **Integrity** spans two related concepts:
    - **Data integrity** assures that data and programs are changed only in a specific and authorized manner. This encompasses **data authenticity**, which means that a digital object is indeed what it claimed to be, and **nonrepudiation**, which is assurance that the sender of information is provided with proof of delivery and the recipient is provided with proof of the sender's identity.
    - **System integrity** assures that a system performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner, free from deliberate or inadvertent unauthorized manipulation of the system.
3. **Availability** assures that systems work promptly and service is not denied to authorized users.

Some in the security field feel that the following concepts should also be added:

4. **Authenticity** is the property of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted with confidence in the validity of a transmission, a message, or message originator. This means verifying that users are who they say they are and that each input arriving at the system came from a trusted source.
5. **Accountability** is the requirement that actions of an entity to be traced uniquely back to that entity. This allows security breaches to be traced back to the responsible party.
