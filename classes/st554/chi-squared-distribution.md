# Chi-Squared $(\chi^2)$ Distribution

The chi-squared distribution describes the probability distribution of the sum of squared independent and identically distributed standard normal random variables, commonly used in statistical hypothesis testing and confidence interval calculations.

An $\chi^2$ random variable is denoted as followed:

$$ X \sim \chi^2(p) $$

Note that the exponential distribution is a gamma distribution  that can be modeled as such:

$$ X \sim \text{Gamma}(\frac{p}{2}, 2) $$
