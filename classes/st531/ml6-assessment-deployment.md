## 6.1 - Model Assessment and Comparison

| Prediction Type | Assessment Measures |
| - | - |
| Decision | Accuracy, Misclassification, Profit/loss |
| Ranking | C-statistic, Gini coefficient |
| Estimate | Average square error, Root mean square error, Schwarz criterion (SC), Akaike's information criterion (AIC) |

$$ \text{Sensitivity} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}} $$

$$ \text{Specificity} = \frac{\text{TN}}{\text{TN} + \text{FP}} $$
