Course Description
****************

Modeling issues for multiple linear regression are discussed in the context of data analysis. These include the use of residual plots, transformations, hypothesis tests, outlier diagnostics, analysis of covariance, variable selection techniques, weighted least squares and colinearity. The uses of multiple logistic regression are similarly discussed for dealing with binary-valued dependent variables.
