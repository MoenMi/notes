# COPL 3 - Describing Syntax and Semantics

## 3.1 - Introduction

A major problem in describing a language is the diversity of people who must understand the description, including initial evaluators, implementors, and users.

The **syntax** of a programming language is the form of its expressions, statements, and program units.

The **semantics** of a programming language is the meaning of the expressions, statements, and program units.

## 3.2 - The General Problem of Describing Syntax

A **sentence** or a statement is a string of a language. The smallest syntactic unit of a language is called a **lexeme**. Lexemes are partitioned into groups (variables, methods, classes, etc.). These categories of lexemes are called **tokens**.

### 3.2.1 - Language Recognizers

A **language recognizer** is a device that determines if a string of characters is a part of a language. 

### 3.2.2 - Language Generators

A **language generator** is a device that can be used to generate the sentences of a language.
