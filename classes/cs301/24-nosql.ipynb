    "\n",
    "- Can represent relationships in data\n",

    "- Indexing structures\n",
    "- Consistent values in database (transactions)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relational Negatives\n",
    "\n",
    "- RDBS can be strict and complex\n",
    "    - Want more freedom and/or simplicity\n",
    "- Overhead of object to relational mapping\n",
    "    - Want to store as is\n",
    "- Cannot always partition/distribute from a single database server\n",
    "    - Want to distribute data\n",
    "- RDBS limited in throughput\n",
    "    - Want higher throughput\n",
    "- Must scale up (expensive servers)\n",
    "    - Want to scale out (wide - cheap servers)\n",
    "- RDBS providers were slow to move to the cloud\n",
