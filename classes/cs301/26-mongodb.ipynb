    "- JSON and XML\n",
    "- Binary forms like BSON, PDF, and Microsoft Office documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Documents are good for storing semi-structured data, but only okay structured and unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document stores are similar to key-value stores, but provide more functionality. They recognize the structure of the objects stored in the database, and these objects are grouped into collections. Document stores have simple query mechanisms to search collections for attribute values.\n",

    "- Documents are addressed in a database via a unique key\n",
    "- Allows beyond the simple key-value lookup (think nested lists and dictionaries in JSON)\n",

    "\n",
    "MongoDB stores objects in BSON format\n",
    "- Binary encoding of JSON\n",
    "- Uses associative arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "A field in MongoDB can be any BSON data type\n",

    "## Using MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "To issue a command in MongoDB, you must first specify the database:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "use DatabaseName\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Collection methods:\n",
    "- CRUD\n",
    "    - insert(), find(), update(), remove()\n",
    "- Aggregate\n",
    "    - count(), aggregate(), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "databaseName.collectionName.methodName()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a collection:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "db.createCollection(name, options)\n",
    "db.createCollection(\"project\", {capped: true, size: 1310720, max: 500})\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Can specify the `size`, `index`, and `max #`\n",
    "- If collection is `capped`, the size is fixed and going over the limit will overwrite old data, or you can use `insert` and it will be created\n",
    "\n",
    "With MongoDB, you can build a database incrementally without modifying the schema, since there is no schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each document in a database automatically gets an \"_id\" field.\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "db.hotels.insert({name: \"Motel 6\", options: {smoking: \"yes\", pet: \"yes\"}});\n",

    "```\n",

    "We can also use other comparators, e.g. \\$gt, \\$lt, \\$regex, etc:\n",
    "```console\n",
