    "## Cursor Functions/Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of a find() query is a **cursor** object. A cursor is a pointer to the result set of a query, and it is an iterable object (forward only).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cursor functions** apply functions to the result of a query (e.g. limit(), skip(), etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "db.collection.find().skip(10).limit(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods you can use on a cursor:\n",
    "\n",
    "- cursor.count()\n",
    "```console\n",
    "db.collection.find().count()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- cursor.pretty()\n",
    "```console\n",
    "db.collection.find().pretty()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- cursor.sort()\n",
    "```console\n",
    "db.collection.find().sort({field:1})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- cursor.toArray()\n",
    "```console\n",
    "db.collection.find().toArray\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- cursor.hasNext(), cursor.next()\n",
    "```console\n",
    "db.collection.find().hasNext()\n",
    "db.collection.find().next()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the cursor returned from a command such as `db.collection.find()` is not assigned to a variable using the **var keyword**, then the mongo shell automatically iterates the cursor up to 20 times. You must indicate if you want it to iterate 20 more times.\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "var myCursor = db.users.find({type:2})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To iterate 20 more times:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "myCursor\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "myCursor.next()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To print using mongo shell script in the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set a variable equal to a cursor\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "var c = db.testData.find()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Print with a while loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "while (c.hasNext()) printjson(c.next());\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `toArray()` function to iterate the cursor and return the documents in an array. This function loads all documents returned by the cusor into RAM. You can use an index with this function (e.g. array[3]).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matching an Array Field\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the find() function to query an array field, the arguments listed yield the associated results:\n",
    "- `{field:[val1, val2]}`: the array field has exactly two vals in the order specified\n",
    "- `{field:{$all:[val1, val2]}}`: the array contains the two vals\n",
    "- `{field:val}`: the array contains the val\n",
    "- `{field:{$elemMatch:{$gte:80,$lt:90}}}`: the array contains at least one element satisfying the conditions\n",
    "- `{field:{$size:2}}`: the array has the given size\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Functions\n",

    "\n",
    "**Single purpose aggregation** aggregates documents into a single collection, but lacks the capability to pipeline the data. It includes the `count()` and `distinct()` operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Pipeline Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipeline aggregation** is modeled after data processing pipelines. It includes basic operations, which apply filters like queries do; operations to sort documents; and grouping/aggregate operations. These operations include:\n",
    "- Stage operators: `$project`, `$match`, `$limit`, `$group`, and `$sort`\n",
    "- Boolean operators: `$and`, `$or`, and `$not`\n",

    "- Date, variable, literal, and conditional operators\n",
    "- Accumulators: `$sum`, `$max`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `$match` and `$project` in a similar manner to `find()`. The following produce the same output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "db.books.find({name:\"Thomas\"},{title:1, author:1})\n",
    "```\n",

    "    {$project:{title:1,author:1}}\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If using cursor sort, you can apply sort after `find()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "find(...).sort({sortkey:1})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If using aggregation, you can use a collection sort:\n",
