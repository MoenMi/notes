# 7 - Consumers, Producers, and the Efficiency of Markets

This chapter covers **welfare economics**, which is the study of how the allocation of resources affects economic well-being.

## 7.1 - Consumer Surplus

### Willingness to Pay

A buyer's maximum value that they are willing to pay for a good or service is called their **willingness to pay**.

**Consumer surplus** is the amount a buyer is willing to pay for a good minus the amount the buyer actually pays for it.

$$ \text{Consumer surplus} = \text{Value to buyers } - \text{ Amount paid by buyers} $$

### Using the Demand Curve to Measure Consumer Surplus

The **marginal buyer** is the buyer who would leave a market first if the price of a good were any higher.

The area below the demand curve and above the price measures the consumer surplus in a market.

### What Does Consumer Surplus Mean?

Consumer surplus measures the benefit that buyers derive from the market as the buyers themselves perceive it. In most markets, this reflects consumer well-being.

## 7.2 - Producer Surplus

### Cost and Willingness to Sell

In this situation, cost is interpreted as the opportunity cost (i.e. the cost of choosing not to do anything else).

**Producer surplus** is the amount a seller is paid minus his cost of production.

$$ \text{Producer surplus} = \text{Amount received by sellers } - \text{ Cost to sellers} $$

### Using the Supply Curve to Measure Producer Surplus

The **marginal seller** is the seller who would leave a market first if the price of a good were any lower.

The area below the price and above the supply curve measures the producer surplus in a market.

## 7.3 - Market Efficiency

### Benevolent Social Planners

**Total surplus**, calculated as the sum of consumer and producer surplus, is a measure of societal well-being.

$$ 
\begin{align*}
    \text{Total surplus} &= \text{Consumer surplus } + \text{ Producer surplus} \\
    &= (\text{Value to buyers } - \text{ Amount paid by buyers}) + (\text{Amount received by sellers } - \text{ Cost to sellers}) \\
    &= \text{Value to buyers } - \text{ Cost to sellers}
\end{align*}
$$

If the allocation of resources maximizes total surplus, economists say that the allocation exhibits **efficiency**.

**Equality** is the property of distributing economic prosperity uniformly among members of society.

### Evaluating the Market Equilibrium

The area between the supply and demand curves up to the point of equilibrium represents the total surplus of a market.
