# 1 - Ten Principles of Economics

The word 'economy' is derived from the Greek *oikonomos*, which means "one who manages a household."

**Scarcity** means that society has limited resources.

**Economics** is the study of how society manages its scarce resources.

## 1.1 - How People Make Decisions

The first four principles concern individual decision making.

### Principle 1: People Face Trade-Offs

**Efficiency** means that society is geting the greatest benefits from its scarce resources.

**Equality** means that benefits are distributed uniformly among society's members.

### Principle 2: The Cost of Something is What You Give Up to Get It

The **opportunity cost** of an item is what you give up to get it.

### Principle 3: Rational People Think at the Margin

**Rational people** systematically and purposefully do the best they can to achieve their goals, given the available opportunities.

**Marginal change** describes the incremental adjustment to an existing plan of action. Decision making involves **marginal benefits** and **marginal costs**.

### Principle 4: People Respong to Incentives

An **incentive** is something that induces a person to act, such as a punishment or reward.

## 1.2 - How People Interact

The next 3 principles concern how people interact with one another.

### Principle 5: Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off

Trade improves individual economies because it can allow each economy to specialize.

### Principle 6: Markets Are Usually a Good Way to Organize Economic Activity

A **market economy** is an economy that allocates resources through the decentralized decisions of many firms and households as they interact in markets for goods and services.

### Principle 7: Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes

**Property rights** is the ability of an individual to own and exercise control over scarce resource.

**Market failure** describes a situation in which a market left on its own does not allocate resources efficiently. A market failure may be caused by an **externality**, which is the impact of one person's actions on the well-being of a bystander. It may also be caused by **market power**, which is the ability of a single economic actor (or group of actors) to have a substantial influence on market prices.

## 1.3 - How the Economy as a Whole Works

The last 3 principles concern the workings of the economy as a whole.

### Principle 8: A Country's Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services

**Productivity** measures the quantity of goods and services produced from each unit of labor input. Standard of living in different countries is generally closely correlated with productivity.

### Principle 9: Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money

**Inflation** is an increase in the overall level of prices in the economy.

### Principle 10: Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-Off between Inflation and Unemployment

The short-term effects of an increase in the money supply are generally as follows:

- Increasing the money supply stimulates the overall level of spending and thus the demand for goods and services.
- Over time, higher demand causes firms to raise prices but encourages them to hire more workers to produce a larger quantity of goods and services in the short term.
- More hiring leads to lower unemployment.
