# 4 - The Market Forces of Supply and Demand

## 4.1 - Markets and Competition

### 4.1.1 - What Is a Market?

A **market** is a group of buyers and sellers of a good or service.

### 4.1.2 - What Is Competition?

The term **competitive market** describes a market in which there are so many buyers and sellers that each has little effect on the market price.

If we assume that things are **perfectly competitive**, a market has the following 2 characteristics:
1. The goods offered for sale are exactly the same.
2. The buyers and sellers are so numerous that no single buyer or seller has any influence over the market price.

Since buyers and sellers in a perfectly competitive market must accept the price determined by the market, they are called **price takers**.

A market where there is only one seller and the seller sets the price is called a **monopoly**.

## 4.2 - Demand

### 4.2.1 - The Demand Curve: The Relationship between Price and Quantity Demanded

The **quantity demanded** of any good is the amount that buyers are willing and able to purchase.

The **law of demand** states that all other things being equal, when the price of a good rises, the quantity demand falls, and when the price falls, the quantity demanded rises.

A **demand schedule** is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded, holding constant everything else that influences how much of the good a consumer wants to buy.

The line on a graph denoting the relationship between price and quantity demanded is the **demand curve**. By convention, the y-axis is price and the x-axis is quantity demanded.

### 4.2.2 - Market Demand vs. Individual Demand

**Market demand** is the sum of all the individual demands for a particular good or service.
