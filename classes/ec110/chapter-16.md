# 16 - Monopoly

## 16.1 - Why Monopolies Arise

A firm is a **monopoly** if it is the sole soller of a product that doesn't have close substitutes. The fundamental cause of monopoly is **barriers to entry**, which have three main sources:
1. **Monopoly resources**: A signle firm owns a key resource required for production.
2. **Government regulation**: The government gives a single firm the exclusive right to produce a good or service.
3. **The production process**: A single firm can produce output at a lower cost than a larger number of firms can.

A **natrual monopoly** is a type of monopoly that arises because a single firm can suppoy a good or service to an entire market at a lower cost than two or more firms could. For these firms, a greater quantity of output yields a smaller average total cost.

## 16.2 - How Monopolies Make Production and Pricing Decisions

### Monopoly vs. Competition

In a monopoly, the firm's demand curve is the same as the market demand curve.

### A Monopoly's Revenue

A monopolist's marginal revenue is less than the price of its good.

When a monopoly increases the amount it sells, there are two effects on total revenue:
- **Output effect**: More output is sold, so $Q$ is higher, which increases total revenue.
- **Price effect**: The price falls, so $P$ is lower, which decreases total revenue.

### Profit Maximization

When marginal revenue exceeds marginal costs, production should be increased.

The monopolist's profit-maximizing quantity of output is determined by the intersection of the marginal-revenue curve and the marginal-cost curve.

$$
\begin{align*}
    &\text{For a competitive firm:} & P = MR = MC \\
    &\text{For a monopoly firm:} & P > MR = MC
\end{align*}
$$

In competitive markets, price equals marginal cost. In monopolized markets, price exceeds marginal cost.

### A Monopoly's Profit

For a monopoly,

$$ \text{Profit} = (P - ATC) \times Q $$

## 16.3 - The Welfare Cost of Monopolies

In a monopoly, the socially efficient quantity is found where the demand curve and the marginal-cost curve intersect.

The socially efficient outcome is found at the intersection of the demand and marginal-cost curves. However, the monopolist produces less than the socially efficient quantity of outcome.

## 16.4 - Price Discrimination

**Price discrimination**, also known as **price customization**, is the business practice of selling the same good at different prices to different customers.

**Arbitrage** is the process of buying a good in one market at a low price and selling it another at a higher price to profit from the price difference.

**Perfect price discrimination** is a situation in which the monopolist knows exactly each customer's willingness to pay and can charge each customer a different price.

Examples of price discrimination:
- Movie tickets
- Airline prices
- Discount opportunites
- Financial aid
- Quantity discounts

## 16.5 - Public Policy toward Monopolies

The courts are more worried about horizontal mergers, and less so about vertical mergers.

**Synergies** are brought about by mergers between two companies that result in more efficient production.
