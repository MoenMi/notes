## 8.1 - The Deadweight Loss of Taxation

### How a Tax Affects Market Participants

The amount that the government gains from a tax can be calculated with the size of the tax $T$ and the quantity of the good sold $Q$:

$$ \text{Tax Revenue} = T \times Q $$

As such, the tax revenue is equal to the area of the tax wedge created by instituting the tax.
