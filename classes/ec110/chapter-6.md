## 6.1 - The Surprising Effects of Price Controls

A **price ceiling** is a legal maximum on the price at which a good can be sold.

A **price floor** is a legal minimum on the price at which a good can be sold.

### How Price Ceilings Affect Market Outcomes

If the price that balances supply and demand is below a price ceiling, that price ceiling is **not binding**.

If the equilibrium price is above the price ceiling, the ceiling has a **binding constraint** on the market. This creates a shortage of the good.

When the government imposes a binding price ceiling on a competitive market, a shortage arises, and sellers must ration scarce goods among potential buyers.

### How Price Floors Affect Market Outcomes

If the equilibrium price is below the price floor, it is is binding. A binding price floor causes a surplus.
