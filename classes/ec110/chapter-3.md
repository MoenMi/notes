# 3 - Interdependence and the Gains from Trade

## 3.1 - A Parable for the Modern Economy

This parable involves a simple economy where the only goods in the world are meat and potatoes. The only two people in this world are a cattle rancher named Ruby and a potato farmer named Frank. Ruby and Frank would both like to eat a diet of both beef and potatoes.

### 3.1.1 - Production Possibilities

Now suppose that Frank and Ruby each work 8 hours per day and can use this time to engage in some combination of growing potatoes or raising cattle. Note that each of them might produce the two goods at different levels of productivity.
