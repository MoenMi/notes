# 14 - The Costs of Production

**Industrial organization** is the study of how firms' decisions about prices and quantities depend on the market conditions they face.

## 14.1 - What Are Costs?

### Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Profit

**Total revenue** is the amount that a firm receives from the sale of its output.

**Total cost** is the market value of the inputs a firm uses in production.

**Profit** is the total revenue minus total cost.

$$ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} $$

**Explicit costs** are input costs that require an outlay of money by the firm.

**Implicit costs** are input costs that do not require an outlay of money by the firm.

### Economists and Accountants Measure Profit Differently

An implicit cost that every business faces is the opportunity cost of financial capital. This cost is recognized by economists, but not accountants, since no money flows from this amount.

**Economic profit** is total revenue minus total cost, including both implicit and explicit costs.

$$ \text{Economic profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Explicit cost} - \text{Implicit cost} $$

**Accounting profit** is total revenue minus total explicit cost.

$$ \text{Accounting profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Explicit cost} $$
