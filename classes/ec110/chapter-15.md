# 15 - Firms in Competitive Markets

A firm that influence the market price of the good it sells is said to have **market power**.

## 15.1 - What is a Competitive Market?

### The Meaning of Competition

A **competitive market**, sometimes called a **perfectly competitive market**, has two (or sometimes three) characteristics:
1. The market has many buyers and many sellers.
2. The goods offered by the various sellers are largely the same.
3. (Sometimes) Firms can freely enter or exit the market.

Under these conditions, the actions of any single buyer or seller have a negligible impact on the market price.

Buyers and sellers in competitive markets must accept the price the market determines and are called **price takers**.

### The Revenue of a Competitive Firm

In a competitive market, the amount of a good produced has no effect on the price that it is sold, since all sellers must adhere to the market price. For all types of firms, the average revenue is equal to the price of the good.

For competitive firms, marginal revenue is equal to the price of the good.

## 15.2 - Profit Maximization and the Competitive Firm's Supply Curve

### The Marginal-Cost Curve and the Firm's Supply Decision

Because the firm's marginal-cost curve determines the quantity of the good the firm is willing to supply at any price, the marginal-cost curve is also the competitive firm's supply curve.

### The Firm's Short-Run Decision to Shut Down

A **shutdown** refers to short-run decision not to produce anything during a specific period because of current market conditions. **Exit** refers to a long-run decision to leave the market.

In the short-run, fixed costs are considered a **sunk cost**.

A firm makes the decision to shutdown if the revenue that it would earn from producing is less than its variable costs of production.

$$ \text{Shutdown if } TR < VC $$

$$ \text{Shutdown if } \frac{TR}{Q} < \frac{VC}{Q} $$

$$ \text{Shutdown if } P < AVC $$

The competitive firm's short-run supply curve is the portion of its marginal-cost curve that lies above the average-variable-cost curve.

### Spilt Milk and Other Sunk Costs

A **sunk cost** is a cost that has already been committed and cannot be recovered.

### The Firm's Long-Run Decision to Exit or Enter a Market

A firm exits a market if the revenue it would get from producing is less than its total cost of production.

$$ \text{Exit if } TR < TC $$

$$ \text{Exit if } \frac{TR}{Q} < \frac{TC}{Q} $$

$$ \text{Exit if } P < ATC $$

The entry rule is similarly

$$ \text{Enter if } P > ATC $$

The competitive firm's long-run supply curve is the portion of its marginal-cost curve that lies above the average-total-cost curve.
