# 15 - Firms in Competitive Markets

A firm that influence the market price of the good it sells is said to have **market power**.

## 15.1 - What is a Competitive Market?

### The Meaning of Competition

A **competitive market**, sometimes called a **perfectly competitive market**, has two (or sometimes three) characteristics:
1. The market has many buyers and many sellers.
2. The goods offered by the various sellers are largely the same.
3. (Sometimes) Firms can freely enter or exit the market.

Under these conditions, the actions of any single buyer or seller have a negligible impact on the market price.

Buyers and sellers in competitive markets must accept the price the market determines and are called **price takers**.

### The Revenue of a Competitive Firm

In a competitive market, the amount of a good produced has no effect on the price that it is sold, since all sellers must adhere to the market price. For all types of firms, the average revenue is equal to the price of the good.

For competitive firms, marginal revenue is equal to the price of the good.
