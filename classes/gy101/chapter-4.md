# 4 - Atmospheric Moisture

## 4.2 - What Is Humidity?

The amount of water vapor in the air is **humidity**.
- **Absolute humidity** describes the mass of water vapor in the atmosphere.
- The amount of atmospheric pressure contributed by water vapor is called **vapor pressure**.

The maximum amount of water vapor that air can hold is called **water-vapor capacity**, and it varies by air temperature. If the air is holding as much water vapor as it can for a given temperature, it is **saturated**.
- **Relative humidity** is a measure saturation as a percentage.
- **Specific humidity** compares the mass of water vapor in a body of air to the total mass of that air.

## 4.5 - What Happens When Air Rises or Sinks?

This section concerns rising parcels of air. When there is no energy exchanged between a parcel and its surroundings the process is said to be **adiabatic**. When such an exchange does occur, it is called **diabatic**.
- The **lapse rate** is the change in temperature divided by the change in height, and reported as a ratio ($\text{C}\degree/ \text{km}$).
- If any parcel of air rises adaibatically and does not become saturated during its ascent, it always cools at $10 \ \text{C}\degree/ \text{km}$. This constant lapse rate, called the **unsaturated adiabatic lapse rate**, applies everywhere adiabatically rising air remains unsaturated.
