## 3.5 - What Are Some Significant Regional Winds?

A **Chinook wind** can refer to several different types of wind, but are most commonly used to refer to warm, dry wind that blows down the flanks of a mountain range.
- Chinook winds are formed when humid winds are pushed against the windward side of a mountain. When the humid air rises up the mountain, it cools, forming clouds, which releases latent heat.
- When the air reaches the leeward side of the moutnain, it continues to dry out and heat up.

**Katabatic winds** blow down from cold, elevated areas (glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica). They are typically cold, but dry.
