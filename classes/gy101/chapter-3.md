## 3.4 - How Do Variations in Temperature and Pressure Cause Local Atmospheric Circulation?

A **sea breeze**, or **onshore breeze**, is a wind that blows from the sea to land during the day.
1. During daytime hours, the land heats up significantly, since it has a low specific heat.
2. At the same time, the air over water is chilled by the comparatively cool water and by the cooling associated with evaporation. The cool air sinks, and this creates high-pressure area over the water.
3. The difference between the high pressure over water and the low pressure over land creates an onshore breeze from sea to land.
4. The air over land is displaced, rising upward and moving out to sea.
5. The rising humid air on the coast can form clouds and fog.

A **land breeze**, or an **offshore breeze**, is a wind that blows from land to sea during the night.
1. The land cools at night, causing the relatively cool air over the land to sink, forming a high pressure area.
2. Due to the water's high specific heat, it stays relatively warm. Therefore, the air above the water rises, creating low pressure over the water.

## 3.5 - What Are Some Significant Regional Winds?

A **Chinook wind** can refer to several different types of wind, but are most commonly used to refer to warm, dry wind that blows down the flanks of a mountain range.
- Chinook winds are formed when humid winds are pushed against the windward side of a mountain. When the humid air rises up the mountain, it cools, forming clouds, which releases latent heat.
- When the air reaches the leeward side of the moutnain, it continues to dry out and heat up.

**Katabatic winds** blow down from cold, elevated areas (glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica). They are typically cold, but dry.
