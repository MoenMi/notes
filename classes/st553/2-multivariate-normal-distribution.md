## 2.1 - Review of the Univariate Normal Distribution

A **normal probability distribution**, also known as a **Gaussian probability distribution**, expresses the probabilities of outcomes for a continuous random variable $x$ with a particular symmetric and unimodal distribution. This density function is given by

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} e^{\frac{-(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}} $$

where
- $\mu$ = mean
- $\sigma$ = standard deviation

Characteristics of the normal probability distribution:
- There are an infinite number of normal distributions, each defined by their own unique combination of the mean $\mu$ and the standard deviation $\sigma$.
- $\mu$ determines the central location and $\sigma$ determines the spread or width.
- The distribution is symmetric about $\mu$.
- It is unimodal.
- $\mu$ = $M_d$ = $M_o$
- It is asymptotic with respect to the horizontal axis.
- The area under the curve is $1$.
- It is neither platykrurtic nor leptokurtic.
- It follows the empirical rule:

$$ \begin{align*}
    P(\mu - 1\sigma \leq x \leq \mu + 1\sigma) &\approx 0.68 \\
    P(\mu - 2\sigma \leq x \leq \mu + 2\sigma) &\approx 0.95 \\
    P(\mu - 3\sigma \leq x \leq \mu + 3\sigma) &\approx 0.997
\end{align*} $$

- The shape of the curve is entirely determined by $\sigma$.

### Standard Normal Distribution

The **standard normal distribution** is the probability distribution associated with any normal random variable (usually denoted $z$) that has $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$.
