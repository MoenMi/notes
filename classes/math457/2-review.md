## 2.1 - Sample Space

The **sample space** ($\Omega$) is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

For example, the event that exactly two coins show heads when three are flipped is:

$$ A = \{ HHT, HTH, THH \} $$

## 2.2 - Formulae to Compute Probabilities of Events

**The Additive Law of Probability**: 

$$ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) $$

If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then

$$ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) $$

## 2.3 - Conditional Probability
