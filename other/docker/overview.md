# Docker

See the Docker documentation: https://docker-curriculum.com/

## Introduction

**Docker** is an open-source project that automates the deployment of software applications inside containers by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of OS-level virtualization on Linux. It allows users to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.

**Containers** are an alternate approach to VMs, providing many of the isolation benefits at a fraction of the computing power.

## Getting Started

Install Docker, and then run the following to test whether the installation worked:

```shell
docker run hello-world
```
